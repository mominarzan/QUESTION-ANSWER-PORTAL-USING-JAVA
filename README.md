QUESTION ANSWER PORTAL

Introduction

This project is used to implement an auto generating question based software for educational practice which will be better than regular book practice. As we see usage of computers and software are increasing in present trend developing this education software will be very helpful for students. Now a days many competitive exams are conducted using online software students can get practiced to the environment.
This application is developed using a sequence of general purpose syntactic transformation to turn sentences in to questions. Based on the quality of the questions educators can use give these questions to students for best practice.
Using this application online test system will be simplified and using of manual paper system will be reduced, this is best practice for reducing paper usage, educators and  students can save lot of time. This application will help educators to evaluate candidates standard using this automated system. And one of the best features is it can be practiced through online.
This project will create new environment for research which can be used for intelligent tutorial system and closed-domain question answering system. This application is new method to replace existing methods with template or syntax based methods. 


Algorithm:
 Step 1: start 
 Step 2: create class Random_gen
 create Random_number() method  using random module
return random number
 Step 3: create class Question
 create Ques() method  which has switch case .each switch cases consist of question and answer key
return the question and answer key
Step 4 :   create class Calculate
 create marks() method 
return marks obtain
Step 5:  create class Check which inherits Question class 
 Check_ans() method
If(answerkey==entered)
return 1
else 
return 0
6. Step 6: create Main class
It will have object of all class 
While(game<=no of question in portal)
Print question
Print total marks calculated 
8: Stop



 Conclusion:
This program helps us to understand the concept of methods, inheritance, switch case, various loops and condition of java 



Future Scope:
•	Generally, we have seen that java programming language is extensively used for web development, application development, system administration, developing games etc.
•	But do you know there are some future technologies that are relying on java? As a matter of fact, java has become the core language as far as the success of these technologies is concerned. Let’s dive into the technologies which use java as a core element for research, production and further developments.
